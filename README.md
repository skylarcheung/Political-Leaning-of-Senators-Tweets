# Political-Leaning-of-Senators-Tweets
<h3> Code tests Jon Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory using tweets collected from active Republican and Democratic senators in the United States.</h3> 

Includes scraped tweets sorted into two spreadsheets (one for each party) and R code to run the regression.
Hello Github friend, this is fairly straightforwardâ€”or at least, it should be. <br><br>
Import both spreadsheets before running code. Excluded is the spreadsheet containing independent tweets, but I can make them available if you please.
Lots of comments in the code, should be helpful.
Please don't share either the spreadsheets or the code without permission. <br><br>
Tons of credit to Joshua Kazdan, who helped write the code that made all the collected tweets worth something.
