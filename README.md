# Political-Leaning-of-Senators-Tweets
Testing Jon Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory using tweets collected from active Republican and Democratic senators in the United States. Includes scraped tweets sorted into two spreadsheets (one for each party) and R code to run the regression.
Hello Github friend, this is fairly straightforwardâ€”or at least, it should be.
Import both spreadsheets before running code. Excluded is the spreadsheet containing independent tweets, but I can make them available if you please.
Lots of comments in the code, should be helpful.
Please don't share either the spreadsheets or the code without permission. Tons of credit to Joshua Kazdan, who helped write the code that made all the collected tweets worth something.
